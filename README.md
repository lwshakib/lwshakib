# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hey there,

I'm a **fullstack developer** driven by curiosity and a strong commitment to mastering the fields of **Open Source**, **AI**, and **DevOps**. I actively engage in hands-on projects that combine theoretical knowledge with practical application. 

With a mindset focused on **growth**, **collaboration**, and **impact**, I aim to build solutions that are not only technically sound but also meaningful and scalable. My journey is guided by a clear purpose: to learn deeply, build with intention, and contribute to a more innovative, open, and intelligent future.
